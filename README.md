# Extended Minecraft Piano
By default, Minecraft only supports 2 octaves of piano music, and the duration of this sound is fixed - 0.6 seconds. This resouce packs offers up to 6 octaves, and 5 different note durations. 

## Installation
### For players
Go to `https://github.com/KerbalBoy/extended-minecraft-piano/releases/latest/download/ExtendedPiano.zip`, and extract the zip file in your Minecraft resource folder.
### For servers
Add the line `resource-pack=https://github.com/KerbalBoy/extended-minecraft-piano/releases/latest/download/ExtendedPiano.zip` to automatically download the resouce pack for everyone who joins your server.

## Usage
Different sounds are created by placing certain blocks under a noteblock, and right-clicking the noteblock changes the pitch, from one F# to the F# 2 octaves higher. The resource pack works by replacing the default noteblock sounds with piano sounds of different octaves and durations. The replacements used by the resource pack are as follows:
